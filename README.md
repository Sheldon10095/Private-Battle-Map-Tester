Private Battle Map Tester lets you and your friends play on any stage you'd like online in Private Battles! Only the host of the lobby needs to use this program. Other players in the lobby will automatically have the same stage as you, so there is no need to worry about someone else picking the wrong stage!

## Requirements

+ Windows Vista or higher (Mac and Linux users, use Wine)
+ [.NET Framework 4.5.2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=328843)
+ Wii U FW v5.5.x
+ Splatoon v2.12.0
+ [TCPGecko](http://wiiubru.com/appstore/#/app/TCPgecko)

## Usage

- Connect to your Wii U. As the host of the Private Battle while on the stage select screen, select a stage from the dropdown box. 
  - **It is recommended to keep the mode set to Turf War, because other modes can cause some stages to crash every player in the lobby upon attempting to load the stage**

- Connect, choose the current game mode, and check off who you want as an Octoling while in the matchmaking screen. The names will update as they appear in-game only for ranked and turf modes. See known issues for details. Note that the tool must always remain connected for it to work.


## FAQ

### What's the ban risk?

- This program has been tested multiple times, and no bans have happened as a result, meaning it should be 100% safe to use. I am not responsible if the use of this program results in a ban. 

### The "Set First 4 Players to Team Alpha" checkbox isn't working... Why?
- You need to have the checkbox enabled, and then while on the Team Select screen click "Poke". Right after you click Poke, you need to press the "Looks good!" button to finalize the teams. Don't mess with the teams after pressing the poke button, otherwise teams will be reset.

### Everyone's Wii U crashed upon loading the stage... What did I do wrong?
- Chances are you tried using a mode other than Turf War on a non-standard stage. Doing so can have undesired effects.
